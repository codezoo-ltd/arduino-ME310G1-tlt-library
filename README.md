# TLT Library for Arduino

This library allows to use a Telit Charlie board to connect to the Internet over a NBIoT, LTE Cat M1 or 2G network(if fallback is available).

It is a loose porting effort of https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MKRNB Arduino library, providing the same interfaces when possible.

This library requires the ME310 Arduino Library **greater or equal than 2.4.0** version to work.


## Download and install the ME310 Library

Download the ME310 Arduino library from https://github.com/telit/arduino-me310-library, and place the folder in your Arduino libraries folder, or install the new library from the ZIP file.

This Library will simplify the interactions with the ME310G1 Module.
